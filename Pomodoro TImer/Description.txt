Test case written assuming the following scenario:

Let’s say you are in a team focused on building a time tracking software just like this one. https://www.toptal.com/project-managers/tomato-timer​ (Note: this is just the site for reference/visualization)
Currently, a user can login, add an activity and start tracking the time right now. 

As an QA officer for this project, you are required to prepare test case scenarios for a new feature. The feature is the introduction of a technique called Pomodoro within an already built start stop timer.

Here is the feature story for the application. As a user, I would like to be able to use the pomodoro technique of burst and break by default whenever I start a timer.

Acceptance Criteria

-The very first burst should start automatically when I start the timer.
-The length of the burst would be 25 minutes at start.
-Button should function as it is named i.e Start, Stop and Reset
-This should also trigger a notification that says: “It's burst time. Stay focused!”

-30 seconds before the burst, there should be another browser notification: “Your break begins in 30 seconds. Wrap up!”

-After 30 seconds, the burst gets over and the break begins.

-Once the timer reaches to 0s the current burst time, Switch to the break tab duration of 5 minutes.

-The timer starts counting down for the break. There is another notification: “The break has begun. Please stop working and go have fun!”

-Once the break is over, the timer should switch to Pomodoro again.
-At this phase, User should be moved to Pomodoro tab and the break counter should not be visible.
-However, the countdown doesn't begin until the user comes back and actually clicks the Start button.
-Once the user starts the second burst, the same process is followed and next break starts after another 25 minutes.
